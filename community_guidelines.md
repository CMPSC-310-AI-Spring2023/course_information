# Community Guidelines

## Course community guidelines to govern interactions in CMPSC 310 Spring 2023

### Interactions in class and lab

- Be an active listener. If something is not clear, ask questions.
- Be considerate of everyone's varying technical background when presenting or engaging in class/team discussions/work.
- Communicate regularly and appropriately with instructor, TLs, fellow class members, as questions or concerns arise.
- Behave and act respectfully, using considerate language.

### Interactions on Discord

- Don't ping @everyone for communications destined for this class.
- Respect people having varying working hours, do not expect an answer right away.
- Post your issue/error in the course channel with clear description of the issue and images. If you are able to contribute to a solution for an issue someone posted, provide possible solutions.

### Interactions on GitHub

- Make meaningful and descriptive commits, explaining your contribution in a full sentence.
- Make frequent and regular commits.
- Ensure the final commit occurs before the due date.

### Teamwork

Teams are to be self selected. Each team member must:

- Abide by the Honor Code.
- Complete all individual tasks for a team-based project, ensuring to do your part for each project
- Adhere to deadlines, both intermediate and final project deadlines, as well as those set up by the team.
- Communicate with your team members regularly.
- Meet at agreed-upon times outside of class for project work.

### Violations

Students are to report any violations to the professor via a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/EXQtAd5RchnShco58).

- Up to three "Interactions" violations will result in written warnings. After three written warnings from the instructor, student will receive half a course grade  reduction for each further violation. 
- Teamwork guideline violations will result in a grade reduction for the assignment unless extenuating circumstances are presented to the satisfaction of the instructor.
